## Audio Synthesizer with C++ in the Juce framework
Welcome to Kealan's Synthesizer, a fully functional single oscillator Synth with FM modulation, ADSR envelopes and Filter capabilities. This project was created as a learning tool for those interested in music theory and music production. This Synthesizer was created with C++ through the JUCE framework. JUCE is a partially open-source cross-platform C++ application framework, used for the development of desktop and mobile applications. JUCE is used in particular for its GUI and plug-ins libraries. The following is all of the features the synthesizer contains.

### Synthesizer features
#### Oscillator
This synth contains one oscillator with the option of being a Sine, Square or Saw wave, which changes the sound of the waveform and synthesizer. The oscillator module can also warp the sound signal using fm modulation by changing the frequency and the depth.

#### Filter
The filter module on the synth blocks out certain frequencies depending on the inputs selected by the user. There is the option of a Low-Pass, High-Pass and Band-Pass filter which all change the sound differently depending on the frequencies that are blocked out.

#### ADSR
The Syntheszier also features an ADSR module which controls the volumes of the waveform at different intervals, which can shape the sound to make it sound like different instruments eg. A small release value would make the synthesizer sound like an instrument being plucked like a guitar.

#### Filter mod envelope
The final module in the Synthesizer, the Filter Modulator, changes the level that the filter is applied to the sound, which adds another level of complexity to the sounds that the user can make. This module allows the user to make futuristic/sci-fi sounds with the Synth.

## How to run the project
In order to use this Synth on your local machine, download the package from [Here](https://www.kealanssynth.com/) and follow the instructions to install. You must have a Digital Audio Workstation such as FL Studio or Ableton in order to use the Synthesizer.
